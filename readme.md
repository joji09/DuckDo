## DUCKDO - PRODUCTIVITY EXTENSION

A simple Firefox productivity extension to be able to quickly associate a task to a webpage.
No need for bookmarking, just adding the the task in the current page will add it to your to-do list, paired with a completion bar to motivate finishing tasks.

I will be working on the a new feature to be able to store website/bookmarks for resource hoarders like me

### Current Functionalities
* Add Tasks and track progress.
* Link the current open website to the task.

### Future Functionalities
* Create "GROUP" tab to group up tasks with a bookmark system.
* Store bookmarks in groups and label them for easy search.
* Create a feature to share saved tasks/links/groups with other browsers or devices.
